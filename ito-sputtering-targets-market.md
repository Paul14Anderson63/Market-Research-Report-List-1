<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The ITO Sputtering Targets Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Plane Target</li><li>Rotating Target</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>ITO sputtering targets are used in the production of transparent conductive films for electronic devices. Plane targets are stationary and allow for a larger target area, resulting in higher material utilization but lower deposition rates. Rotating targets, on the other hand, spin during the sputtering process, enabling uniform deposition and higher deposition rates. The choice between plane and rotating targets depends on the specific requirements of the application, such as deposition uniformity, speed, and material efficiency.</p></p>
