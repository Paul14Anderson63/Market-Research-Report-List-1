<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Water Sensitive Ink Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Humidity Sensitive Apochromatic Ink (Reversible)</li><li>Humidity Sensitive Color Spreading</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Water sensitive ink is a type of ink that responds to changes in humidity levels. One market type is the humidity sensitive apochromatic ink, which is reversible in nature. This means that when exposed to high humidity, the ink loses its color and becomes transparent. However, when the humidity levels decrease, the ink regains its original color. Another market type is the humidity sensitive color spreading ink, where the ink spreads and expands when exposed to humidity. This creates unique visual effects, making it an attractive option for various applications.</p></p>
