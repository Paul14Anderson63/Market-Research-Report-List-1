<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wall Mounted Hood Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Deep Cover Type</li><li>Shallow Cover Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Wall mounted hoods are ventilation devices used over cooking areas to remove smoke, odors, and grease. There are two main types: deep cover type and shallow cover type. The deep cover type extends further down the wall, providing greater coverage and capturing a larger amount of airborne particles. On the other hand, the shallow cover type has a more compact design and is suitable for smaller kitchens or where space is limited.
