<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pneumatic Diaphragm Valve Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Normally Closed Type</li><li>Normally Open Type</li><li>Reciprocating Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Pneumatic Diaphragm Valve Market includes three main types: Normally Closed Type, Normally Open Type, and Reciprocating Type. </p><p>1. Normally Closed Type valves maintain a closed position when no air pressure is applied, and open when the air pressure is introduced.</p><p>2. Normally Open Type valves operate in reverse. They remain open in the absence of air pressure and close when air pressure is supplied.</p><p>3. Reciprocating Type valves have a reciprocating motion to control the flow. They can be adjusted to stay partially open or closed according to the required flow rate.</p></p>
