<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Copper Based Shape Memory Alloys Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>High Temperature Austenite Phase</li><li>Low Temperature Martensite Phase</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Copper-based shape memory alloys are materials that exhibit two distinct phases: the high-temperature austenite phase and the low-temperature martensite phase. The high-temperature austenite phase occurs at elevated temperatures, where the material is strong and easily deformable. The low-temperature martensite phase occurs at lower temperatures, where the material becomes softer and can undergo large deformations. These two phases give copper-based shape memory alloys their unique property of being able to "remember" their original shape and return to it when heated or cooled, enabling various applications in industries including aerospace and biomedical.</p></p>
