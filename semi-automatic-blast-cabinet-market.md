<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Semi-Automatic Blast Cabinet Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pressure Blast Cabinet</li><li>Suction Blast Cabinet</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The semi-automatic blast cabinet market is divided into two types: pressure blast cabinet and suction blast cabinet. Pressure blast cabinets use pressurized air or water to propel abrasive material against the surface to be cleaned or treated. This type of cabinet is suitable for heavy-duty applications and provides high cleaning efficiency. On the other hand, suction blast cabinets operate by creating a vacuum that draws the abrasive material into a hand-held gun, which is then directed towards the surface. Suction blast cabinets are commonly used for smaller-scale operations and lighter cleaning tasks.</p></p>
