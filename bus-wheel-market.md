<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bus Wheel Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Casting</li><li>Forging</li><li>Other</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The bus wheel market is divided into three types: casting, forging, and other markets. Casting in this context refers to the process of manufacturing wheels by pouring molten metal into a mold and allowing it to solidify. Forging, on the other hand, involves shaping the wheel by pounding or compressing metal under high pressure. The "other" market category includes alternative methods such as composite materials or innovative manufacturing techniques that are less commonly used in the bus wheel industry.</p></p>
