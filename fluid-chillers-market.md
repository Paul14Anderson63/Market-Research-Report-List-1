<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fluid Chillers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Water Cooled</li><li>Air Cooled</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Fluid chillers are widely used to regulate temperatures in various industrial processes. The two main types of fluid chillers are water-cooled and air-cooled. Water-cooled chillers extract heat by circulating water through a condenser, which is then cooled via a cooling tower. This type is effective for large cooling loads and offers higher efficiency. On the other hand, air-cooled chillers use ambient air to dissipate heat from the condenser, making them suitable for smaller cooling applications. They are easier to install, require less maintenance, but are less efficient than water-cooled chillers.</p></p>
