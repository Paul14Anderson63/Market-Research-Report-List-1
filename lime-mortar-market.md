<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Lime Mortar Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hydraulic Lime Mortars</li><li>Non-hydraulic Lime Mortar</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Lime Mortar market can be categorized into two types: Hydraulic Lime Mortars and Non-hydraulic Lime Mortar. Hydraulic Lime Mortars are made by blending quicklime with other materials, such as volcanic ash or pozzolana, which react with moisture and harden over time. These mortars offer better strength and durability, making them suitable for structures exposed to harsh environments. Non-hydraulic Lime Mortars, on the other hand, do not harden through a chemical reaction with moisture. Instead, they rely on carbonation, absorbing carbon dioxide from the air to gradually harden. These mortars are commonly used for repair and conservation work on historic buildings.</p></p>
