<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Water Pump Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mechanical Water Pump</li><li>Electric Water Pump</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The automotive water pump market comprises two main types: mechanical water pumps and electric water pumps. Mechanical water pumps are traditional pumps driven by the engine's crankshaft through a belt, forcing coolant to circulate within the engine. On the other hand, electric water pumps are powered by electrical energy and can operate independently of the engine. These pumps provide more control over coolant flow and reduce engine load. They are commonly used in electric and hybrid vehicles as well as for enhanced engine cooling in performance cars.</p></p>
