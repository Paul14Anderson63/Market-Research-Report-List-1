<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Oilfield Demulsifiers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cationic Demulsifiers</li><li>Anionic Demulsifiers</li><li>Non-ionic Demulsifiers</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Oilfield demulsifiers are chemicals that help separate water and oil in the oilfield industry. They are classified into three types: cationic demulsifiers, anionic demulsifiers, and non-ionic demulsifiers. Cationic demulsifiers are positively charged molecules and are useful for breaking emulsions of water-in-oil. Anionic demulsifiers are negatively charged and effective in breaking oil-in-water emulsions. Non-ionic demulsifiers lack any charge and can break both types of emulsions. Each type has its own properties and applications in the oilfield industry, providing efficient separation of water and oil.</p></p>
