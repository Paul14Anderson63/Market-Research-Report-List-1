<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Digital Filter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Infinite Impulse Response (IIR)</li><li>Finite Impulse Response (FIR)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The digital filter market comprises two major types: Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) and Finite Impulse Response (FIR). IIR filters employ feedback and have an infinite impulse response, meaning they can have a response to past inputs indefinitely. FIR filters, on the other hand, only use feedforward and have a finite impulse response, which means their response to past inputs decays over time. Both types find extensive applications in various industries like telecommunications, audio processing, and image processing, offering distinct advantages based on the specific requirements of the application.</p></p>
