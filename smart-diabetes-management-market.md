<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Smart Diabetes Management Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Type 1 Diabetes</li><li>Type 2 Diabetes</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Smart Diabetes Management market is divided into two main types: Type 1 Diabetes and Type 2 Diabetes. Type 1 Diabetes is a chronic condition where the pancreas produces little to no insulin, requiring those affected to rely on external insulin sources. On the other hand, Type 2 Diabetes occurs when the body cannot effectively use insulin or does not produce enough insulin. Both types can benefit from smart diabetes management solutions that utilize technology such as glucose monitoring devices, insulin pumps, and mobile apps to help patients monitor their blood sugar levels, manage insulin dosages, and make informed decisions about their diet and exercise.</p></p>
