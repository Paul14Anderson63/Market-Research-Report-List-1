<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Industrial Vacuum Evaporation System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Multiple Effect</li><li>Single Effect</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The industrial vacuum evaporation system market is divided into two types: multiple effect and single effect systems. Multiple effect systems utilize a series of evaporators, where the heat generated in one effect is utilized to evaporate the liquid in the next effect, increasing the overall energy efficiency. On the other hand, single effect systems have only one evaporator and require a larger amount of energy to evaporate the liquid. These different types cater to the varying needs and preferences of industries in terms of energy efficiency and operational costs.</p></p>
