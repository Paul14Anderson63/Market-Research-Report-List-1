<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Helicopter Rotorblades Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Main Rotor</li><li>Tail Rotor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Helicopter rotorblades market types can be classified into main rotor and tail rotor markets. The main rotor is located above the helicopter and generates the lift needed for the helicopter to remain airborne. It also controls the aircraft's forward, backward, and lateral movements. The tail rotor, on the other hand, is located at the tail of the helicopter and provides anti-torque to counteract the torque produced by the main rotor. It helps maintain the helicopter's stability and prevents it from spinning in the opposite direction of the main rotor.</p></p>
