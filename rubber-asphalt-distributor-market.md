<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rubber Asphalt Distributor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Drag</li><li>Self-Propelled</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Rubber Asphalt Distributor is a specialized vehicle used in road construction for spraying rubber asphalt onto the road surface. There are two main types of Rubber Asphalt Distributors: Drag and Self-Propelled. Drag Distributors are towed by another vehicle and have limited maneuverability. They require a constant and precise speed to ensure accurate and uniform application of rubber asphalt. On the other hand, Self-Propelled Distributors have their own engine and are more flexible in terms of movement. They can be driven independently, allowing for greater control and efficiency in distributing rubber asphalt.</p></p>
