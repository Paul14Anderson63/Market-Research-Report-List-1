<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive HVAC Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Manual HVAC</li><li>Automatic HVAC</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The automotive HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) market consists of two main types: Manual HVAC and Automatic HVAC. Manual HVAC systems require the driver or passengers to manually adjust the temperature, fan speed, and airflow direction according to their preferences. On the other hand, Automatic HVAC systems utilize sensors to automatically monitor and adjust the cabin temperature, detect outside air quality, and control fan speed. Automatic systems provide a more convenient and comfortable experience for the occupants, whereas manual systems offer more control and customization options.</p></p>
