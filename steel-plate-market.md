<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Steel Plate Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hot Rolled Steel Plate</li><li>Cold Rolled Steel Plate</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The steel plate market consists of two main types: hot rolled steel plate and cold rolled steel plate. Hot rolled steel plate is produced by heating up a large steel slab and rolling it into a flat shape. This process is used to create thicker plates with a rougher surface finish. On the other hand, cold rolled steel plate is made by cooling down the hot rolled plate and further processing it by passing it through rollers. This results in a thinner plate with a smoother surface finish.</p></p>
