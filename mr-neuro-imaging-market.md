<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The MR Neuro Imaging Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Superconducting</li><li>Permanent Magnet</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>MR neuro imaging refers to the use of magnetic resonance technology to obtain detailed images of the brain and nervous system. There are two major types of MR neuro imaging systems: superconducting and permanent magnet. Superconducting systems use a powerful electromagnet cooled by liquid helium, which enables high field strengths and superior imaging quality but requires significant infrastructure and maintenance. Permanent magnet systems, on the other hand, use a fixed magnet that does not require cooling and is more cost-effective but typically offers lower field strengths and lesser imaging quality compared to superconducting systems.</p></p>
