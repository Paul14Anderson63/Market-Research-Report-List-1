<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The HDPE Wax Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Oxidation Type HDPE Wax</li><li>Non-oxidation Type HDPE Wax</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The HDPE wax market can be categorized into two types; oxidation type HDPE wax and non-oxidation type HDPE wax. Oxidation type HDPE wax is produced by oxidizing high density polyethylene, resulting in superior characteristics such as higher melting points and improved hardness. On the other hand, non-oxidation type HDPE wax is obtained without undergoing oxidation, making it ideal for applications that require low viscosity and excellent processability. Both types have their own unique properties that cater to different industry needs.</p></p>
