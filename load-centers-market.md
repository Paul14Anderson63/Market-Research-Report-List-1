<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Load Centers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Main Breaker Type</li><li>Main Lugs Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Load Centers, also known as distribution boards or breaker panels, are electrical control panels that distribute electrical power throughout a building. They come in two main market types: Main Breaker Type and Main Lugs Type. In a Main Breaker Type load center, a main circuit breaker is installed as an integral part of the panel, allowing the entire electrical supply to be shut off when needed. On the other hand, Main Lugs Type load centers do not have a main breaker and are used as sub-panels, receiving power from a main breaker panel.</p></p>
