<p><strong>The Gastrointestinal Videoscopes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hard Mirror</li><li>Flexible Soft Mirror</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Gastrointestinal Videoscopes are medical devices used to examine the gastrointestinal tract. There are two types: Hard Mirror and Flexible Soft Mirror. Hard Mirror videoscopes use a rigid tube with a mirror to provide a direct view of the gastrointestinal tract. Flexible Soft Mirror videoscopes, on the other hand, are equipped with a flexible tube that allows for better maneuverability and reach. The flexible tube carries a series of mirrors which reflect the image, providing a high-quality view of the gastrointestinal tract. Both types are essential tools for diagnosing and treating gastrointestinal conditions.</p></p>
