<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wet-End Paper Making Starches Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet End Starch</li><li>Wet End Cationic Starch</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The wet-end paper making starches market mainly consists of two types: wet-end starch and wet-end cationic starch. Wet-end starch is used as a binder and filler to enhance the paper's strength and formation. It helps in improving the retention of fibres and fillers during the papermaking process. On the other hand, wet-end cationic starch has positively charged particles that enable it to interact with the negatively charged fibres, leading to improved paper strength, smoothness, and drainage. Both types of starches contribute to the overall quality and performance of paper production.</p></p>
